<h1> ALgorithms </h1>

<p> To you, the reader - a quick <strong>disclaimer</strong>. I do not claim to cover all material that you may have taught. I simply summarize here what is taught in the majority of textbooks, from my hand written notes, and from when I took the class in undergrad. If there is material you'd like specifically covered, please don't hesistate to reach out. </p>
