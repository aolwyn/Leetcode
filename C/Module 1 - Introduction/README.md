## Introduction to C
<p>C is a powerful and widely-used programming language known for its efficiency and flexibility. It is commonly used in system programming, embedded systems, and application development.
Development environment typically includes a text editor and a C compiler. Popular C compilers include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang.</p>

## Structure of a C Program
A C program consists of functions, variables, and statements enclosed within curly braces. The main function, denoted by `int main()`, serves as the entry point of the program.
The "Hello, World!" program is a basic starting point for understanding program structure and syntax. It prints a simple message to the console.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

```
