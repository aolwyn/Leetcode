# Teaching C Modules

## Note to Erika
Hello Erika, I am going to write the notes and whatnot here for you just because it's easier for me. I'm going to make a safe assumption that you've never used GitHub, but treat it like a giant online folder for storing code.

<br>

I have broken down the notes into topics so you can look into what you need; I would <em>HIGHLY</em> reccomend you go in order. On the left you'll see folders, click them to see whats in them. Only look at what's in the C folder, you'll get lost in the other documents. Alternatively, click the linked below to fast travel between the modules.
